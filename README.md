NASA DATA 
 ~ By Aarushi Vijay

This is an API based application that extracts data of asteroids from NASA and displayed user-friendly information like detailed information about asteroids!

The user can enter dates on their own and wait for the application to work its magic!

The application uses pip extension and NASA APIs. It is coded in Python. This application also has been integrated with Graphic User Interface (Tkinter) to make the app more appealing for the user.
